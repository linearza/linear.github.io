While browsing [Hacker news][hn] today I came across an article on [medium][medium] on what makes a good programmer. This lead me to a list of hilarious quotes that I just thought I'd share again, but of course, all credit to [Naresh Kumar][naresh]:

### Software Developers and Programmers Quotes

1. A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder)

2. Don’t worry if it doesn't work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering)

3. The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray)

4. Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall)

5. Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding)

6. One man’s crappy software is another man’s full time job. (Jessica Gaston)

7. If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along wound destroy civilization. (Gerald Weinberg)

14. When a programming language is created that allows programmers to program in simple English, it will be discovered that programmers cannot speak English. (Anonymous Linguist)

15. Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to do it over? (Anonymous)

16. Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. 

17. Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson's law)

### Programming / Software Development Quotes

1. Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. (Bill Gates)

3. Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen. (Edward V Berard)

4. The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time…The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.(Tom Cargill)

5. Commenting your code is like cleaning your bathroom — you never want to do it, but it really does create a more pleasant experience for you and your guests. (Ryan Campbell)

6. Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning. (Rick Cook)

7. The hardest part of design … is keeping features out. (Donald Norman)

12. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is. (Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut)

13. Ready, fire, aim: the fast approach to software development. Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim: the slow approach to software development. (Anonymous)

15. It is easier to measure something than to understand what you have measured. (Anonymous)

16. Benchmarks don’t lie, but liars do benchmarks. (Anonymous)

17. Better train people and risk they leave – than do nothing and risk they stay. (Anonymous)

25. Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind. (Donald Knuth)

### Software Debugging Quotes

1. Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel)

2. If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra)

3. Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. 

4. It's hard enough to find an error in your code when you're looking for it; it's even harder when you've assumed your code is error-free. (Steve McConnel)

### Software Bugs Quotes
